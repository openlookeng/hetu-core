# VDM Connector

There are use cases that multiple data sources need to be managed and visited together in one single session or view. Also, users may not care about the distribution and source of data at all. The VDM  (Virtualize Data Market) connector is aimed at bringing in this feature to openLooKeng.

The VDM connector supports to:

- Create, update and delete views that combines multiple catalogs
- Visit real data through the views
- Manage user privilege through the views and
- Log the use of VDM views by each user

## Usage

VDM uses openLooKeng metastore to store its database information. It can be stored either on HDFS or relational database, depending on the implementation of openLooKeng metastore. 

Therefore metastore must be configured first. 
* Here is an example of using RDBMS as metastore, create `etc/hetu-metastore.properties`:
```
# the type of metastore storage
hetu.metastore.type=jdbc
# jdbc connection address of database
hetu.metastore.db.url=jdbc:mysql://....
# the user name of the database
hetu.metastore.db.user=root
# the password of database 
hetu.metastore.db.password=123456
```
* Here is an example of using HDFS as metastore，create `etc/hetu-metastore.properties`：

    Path white list：["/tmp", "/opt/hetu", "/opt/openlookeng", "/etc/hetu", "/etc/openlookeng", current workspace]
    
    Notice：avoid to choose root directory; ../ can't include in path; if you config node.date_dir, then the current workspace is the parent of node.data_dir;
    otherwise, the current workspace is the openlookeng server's directory.

```
# the type of metastore storage
hetu.metastore.type=hetufilesystem
# profile name of hetu file system
hetu.metastore.hetufilesystem.profile-name=hdfs-config-metastore
# the path of metastore storage in the hetu file system
hetu.metastore.hetufilesystem.path=/etc/openlookeng/metastore
```    
Check [filesystem](../develop/filesystem.md) for more information.

For user interface, the connector can be accessed from JDBC or command line interface. Currently VDM only supports schemas and views. Tables are NOT supported.

Schema operations are the same as usual openLooKeng catalogs, including `create schema`, `drop schema`, `rename schema` and `show schemas`. 

Views can be created under a specific schema: `create view as ...`, `drop view`.

## Example usage:

Configure a data source `vdm1` by creating `vdm1.properties` in `etc/catalogs` with following contents:

    connector.name=vdm

This example creates a schema `schema1` in `vdm1` catalog, and creates two views from two other different data sources. Note that metastore must be configured in advance (See [usage](./vdm.md#usage) section).

    create schema vdm1.schema1;
    use vdm1.schema1;
    create view view1 as select * from mysql.table.test;
    create view view2 as select * from hive.table.test;
    select * from view1;

VDM datasource can also be managed through dynamic catalog API. See [Dynamic Catalog](../admin/dynamic-catalog.md) topic for more information.
