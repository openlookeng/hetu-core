# SQL Migration Tool

SQL Migration tool helps user to transform SQL Syntax to ANSI 2003 SQL syntax. Currently, only Hive and Impala SQL syntax are supported.

## Usage of SQL Migration Tool
Download `hetu-sql-migration-cli-{version number}-executable.jar`, rename it to `openlk-sql-migration-cli`, make it executable with `chmod +x`, then run it.

**Interactive mode**

This tool can be run in interactive mode. The example is like:

```shell
./openlk-sql-migration-cli --type hive
```

```sql
lk:HIVE>
lk:HIVE> INSERT INTO TABLE table1 VALUES(10, "NAME");
==========converted result==========
INSERT INTO table1
 VALUES
  ROW (10, 'NAME')

=================Success=============
```

| Parameter    | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--type` or `-t` | The type of input SQL statement, such as `hive`, `impala`. It is optional parameter and the default value is `hive`. |


Here are some frequently used command:

| Command          | Description                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `!chtype value;` | change the source sql type of current session          |
| `exit` or `quit` | to exit the interactive mode         |
| `history`        | to get the previous input statements |
| `help`           | displace the help information        |

**Batch Mode**

This tool also can take parameters and running in batch mode. It has five parameters, \"file\", \"sourceType\", \"execute\", \"output\" and \"config\".  The meaning of each parameters lists as follows:

| Parameter    | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--file` or `-f`       | A file that contains SQL statements,  separated by \";\".  All of the SQLs in the file can be converted in batch process. |
| `--type` or `-t` | The type of input SQL statement, such as `hive`, `impala`. It\'s optional parameter and the default value is `hive`. |
| `--output` or `-o`     | the directory to save the converted SQL results. The result file's naming convention will be the input file's name + timestamp + .html suffix.             |
| `--config` or `-c`     | the config file of SQL Migration Tool.                       |
| `--debug` or `-d`     | if set value to 'true', then print the debug information in console.                       |

***Tip***:

*If user has large number of sql statements to convert, the suggested way is to consolidate all the statements into a single file, and use the batch mode.*

Here is an example of batch mode usage:

```shell
    ./openlk-sql-migration-cli --file /home/Query01.sql --output ./
    May 26, 2020 5:27:10 PM io.airlift.log.Logger info
    INFO: Migration Completed.
    May 26, 2020 5:27:10 PM io.airlift.log.Logger info
    INFO: Result is saved to .//Query01_1590485230193.html
```

When `file` is specified, parameter `output` must be provided. The converted result will be a html file in `output` directory. 
You can open that html file via any web browser, and then review the conversion details. 

**Execute Mode**

It is possible to execute a query directly with the command and have the tool exit after transformation completion. Here is the example of using  `execute`:


```shell
./openlk-sql-migration-cli --execute "INSERT INTO TABLE T1 VALUES(10, 'openLooKeng')" --type hive


==========converted result==========
INSERT INTO t1
 VALUES
  ROW (10, 'openLooKeng')

=================Success=============
```

If user specify the parameter `execute` only, the converted result will be printed onto the screen. Optionally, user can specify `output` parameter, the result will be saved into target file.

User can also provide `config` parameter to control the conversion behavior. Following is an example for `config`:

The file name "config.properties" with content is as follows:

``` shell
convertDecimalLiteralsAsDouble=true


./openlk-sql-migration-cli --execute "INSERT INTO TABLE T1 select 2.0 * 3" --config config.properties


==========converted result==========
INSERT INTO t1
SELECT (DECIMAL '2.0' * 3)

=================Success=============
```

Currently, the config file only supports one property `convertDecimalLiteralsAsDouble`. It means whether to convert decimal literals as double or not. The default value is `false`,  which means converting decimal literals to type \"decimal\" .
