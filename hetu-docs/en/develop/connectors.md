# Connectors

Connectors are the source of all data for queries in openLooKeng. Even if your data source doesn\'t have underlying tables backing it, as long as you adapt your data source to the API expected by openLooKeng, you can write queries against this data.

## ConnectorFactory

Instances of your connector are created by a `ConnectorFactory` instance which is created when openLooKeng calls `getConnectorFactory()` on the plugin.
The connector factory is a simple interface responsible for creating an instance of a `Connector` object that returns instances of the following services:

-   `ConnectorMetadata`
-   `ConnectorSplitManager`
-   `ConnectorHandleResolver`
-   `ConnectorRecordSetProvider`

### ConnectorMetadata

The connector metadata interface has a large number of important methods that are responsible for allowing openLooKeng to look at lists of schemas, lists of tables, lists of columns, and other metadata about a particular data source.

This interface is too big to list in this documentation, but if you are interested in seeing strategies for implementing these methods, look at the `example-http` and the Cassandra
connector. If your underlying data source supports schemas, tables and columns, this interface should be straightforward to implement. If you are attempting to adapt something that is not a relational database (as
the Example HTTP connector does), you may need to get creative about how you map your data source to openLooKeng\'s schema, table, and column concepts.

### ConnectorSplitManager

The split manager partitions the data for a table into the individual chunks that openLooKeng will distribute to workers for processing. For example, the Hive connector lists the files for each Hive partition and creates
one or more split per file. For data sources that don\'t have partitioned data, a good strategy here is to simply return a single split for the entire table. This is the strategy employed by the Example HTTP connector.

### ConnectorRecordSetProvider

Given a split and a list of columns, the record set provider is responsible for delivering data to the openLooKeng execution engine. It creates a `RecordSet`, which in turn creates a `RecordCursor` that is used by openLooKeng to read the column values for each row.
