/**
 * Class that holds constant values for supported file attributes
 * To add new attributes, make sure it is supported by both local and hdfs filesystem
 * It is recommended to use the string literal of supported properties from java.nio.file.attribute package
 * to maximize compatibility.
 * <p>
 * When new attributes are added change the getAttribute() methods to cover the newly added one accordingly.
 * The return type of the attribute need to be documented in
 * {@link HetuFileSystemClient#getAttribute(Path, String)}'s java doc.
 * Ensure they have same return type across all filesystems. If not convert them.
 * <p>
 * Tests on the return type should be added in the {@code testGetAttribute()} in all client tests.
