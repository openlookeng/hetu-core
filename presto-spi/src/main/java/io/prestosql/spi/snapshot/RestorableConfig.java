/**
 * Help to clarify snapshot support of the annotated class:
 * - unsupported: controls whether the class is expected to be involved in snapshot. Default is false.
 * - stateClassName: name of state class, the result of capturing the annotated class. Default is class name with State suffix.
 * The state class can also be omitted if there are 0 or 1 fields to capture.
 * - baseClassStateName: name of field in stateClass that corresponds to result of "super.capture()". Default is "baseState".
 * - uncapturedFields: which fields don't need to be captured.
 * <p>
 * A special case is for anonymous classes, where it's not easy to attach this annotation.
 * new @RestorableConfig(...) SomeInterface {
 * int a;
 * ...
 * }
 * This works syntactically, but a Java issue sometimes causes the field "a" to not be accessible by methods in the class.
 * To work around it, for anonymous classes, instead of annotating the class, we allow:
 * new SomeInterface {
 *
 * @RestorableConfig(...) private final RestorableConfig restorableConfig = null;
 * int a;
 * ...
 * }
